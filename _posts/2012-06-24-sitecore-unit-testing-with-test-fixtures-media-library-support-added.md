I recently wrote a post on [Sitecore unit testing with test fixtures](http://hermanussen.eu/sitecore/wordpress/2012/06/sitecore-unit-testing-with-test-fixtures/ "Link to post about Sitecore unit testing with test fixtures"). I&#8217;ve now added support for the media library (updated in <a title="The FixtureDataProvider project on GitHub" href="https://github.com/hermanussen/Sitecore-FixtureDataProvider" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://github.com']);">the project on GitHub</a>).

So now, you can also unit test code that imports an image into the media library.



And here&#8217;s some code to check if it works correctly.
